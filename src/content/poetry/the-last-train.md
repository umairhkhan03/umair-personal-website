The platform grows quiet as dusk settles in,  
A whisper of departure on rusted tracks,  
The last train pulls away, a fading hymn,  
Carrying dreams that never look back.

I watch the red lights blur into the night,  
Each carriage holds a story left untold,  
Of passengers who fled from fading light,  
Seeking warmth in cities gleaming gold.

But I remain here, rooted to this ground,  
Where echoes of arrivals still remain,  
In the silence, I have finally found,  
That home was never on that train.

The station keeper dims the final lamp,  
And I walk home through streets that know my name,  
No longer chasing shadows, bright or damp,  
Content to let the last train go, without shame.
