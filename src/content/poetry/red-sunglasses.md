I wasn't born blind, 

I know how the world looks like. 

My house, the garden, the view from my balcony. 

The sun, the moon, the pretty constellations. 

The clouds, the buildings, the plane I fly on. 

The sky, the earth, the hand that protects me.

The road, the school, the car I travel in. 

The food, the drink, the hand that feeds me.



I love wearing my red sunglasses, even when it's not sunny. 

Mom says they look really good on me, 

Dad says they protect me really well, from the sun and everything else. 

All my friends wear the same ones too, well I suppose they do.

Almost everyone on the streets wears them too, well I suppose they do.



Blood paints them red, privilege fills the lenses. 

I love wearing my red sunglasses, even when it's not sunny. 

I wasn't born blind,

I know how the world looks like.
