Eyes flush red, veins choke on blood,

Now superficial, enjoying the fame,

Your plate flips, the table floods,

Green 'muck' and loathed curry lay,

For you, mother's lips mumble, pray.

The maid wipes the edge, the curry,

Dripping down, dropped down, yet cleaned up. 

In vain, your door slammed shut, echoes,

Plaster chipped, of the wall,

Her hearts chips, starts its downfall.

A CONTINENT ACROSS,

A boy- African, wipes the edge, the curry

Dripping down, a dustbin, yet licked up.

Weeks had passed, waiting for this time,

Weeks had passed, since god had been so kind.



Ears red, mouth swears,

Last shot missed, game lost,

The 20th time, controller tossed,

Curse your luck, curse its cost.

A COUNTRY ACROSS,

Ears blue, a Syrian father of two,

Mouth prays, begs the planes,

Miss your target, jam the rockets,

It may be your 276th burst,

But my daughters, it's her first.



Your eyes clouded with sleep, daydreaming,

The tap left running, sending litres gushing,

Down the sink, down the pipe, down the drain.

A CITY ACROSS,

A mother, dreaming, yet plodding,

2 kilometers, dragged by now,

Any further her feeble body disallows.

The sight of it compensates,

Her sleepless nights, the endless wait.

But, its veracity, disheartens,

Her endeavor, for a vision,

The water, an illusion,

Puts her forever in, oblivion.

For a drop is all that came,

Up the well, up the pipe, up the pail.



Your eyes close, breath eased,

The callus soothed, headache relieved.

Your 500 word assignment's done,

Topic-'Caste- A word of the past"

A DOOR ACROSS,

The "bai" is just done,

Brush, mop, clean, wipe,

Been doing this all her life,

Yet, no sigh, puts up, no fight.

Ever wondered why there's another,

In the kitchen, cooking supper?

A curse, stamped on birth,

Far before her first words,

Yet stuck with her, guides,

Controls, demands, all her life.

Un-changeable, un-washable,

Un-movable, un-undoable,

It reads – "Untouchable".



Your eyes tear up, laughter,

The video went viral, friends on call,

Crack up, celebrate – all,

Just too hilarious – the sight,

The quiet kid in class, his head hangs— edited, morphed,

On a body not his, a monkey's, virtually,

Played on loop forever. 

A MOBILE PHONE ACROSS,

He smiles for he sees,

This pain, anxiety, suffering,

Is finally, the last,

Yet, he feels nothing, 

For the past.

A head now hangs,

Not virtually, in reality,

On a loop – physically – forever. 



A POEM ACROSS, 

Sits the root cause,

benighted, silent, engrossed.
