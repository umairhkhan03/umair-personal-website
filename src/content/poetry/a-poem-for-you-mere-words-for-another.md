A torn shirt for you, this year's gift for another.

Home sweet home for you, crippled ground zero for another.

Mom's caring touch for you, solitary corners of denial for another.

Loving parents for you, brutal orphanages for another.

Destination holidays for you, the candy shop next street for another.

Holes in a shoe for you, holes in a foot of another.

Exotic delicacies for you, dreams of a lifetime for another.

Colourful rainbows for you, grayscale black and white for another.

A subconscious breath for you, a clutching breath of life for another.

All-seeing eyes for you, binding blindness 

of suffocation for another.

Deafening noise for you, Deafening silence for another.

CHERISH.



A belly aching with food for you, a belly aching for food for another.

Refreshing thirst for you, bone dry dehydration for another.

The last drop for you, the only drop for another.

Metres on the treadmill for you, a daily mile tread for another.

A blessing for you, a curse for another.

THANK.



A gentle kiss for you,  life-saving CPR for another.

A red bouquet of love for you, a white bouquet on the coffin for another.

Heaven after life for you, hell before death for another.

The end of peace for you, the start for another.

Life for you, death for another.

LIVE.



Thank you.
