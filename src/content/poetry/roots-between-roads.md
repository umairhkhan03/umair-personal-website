I was born between borders,  
Raised in the space where maps blur—  
Riyadh, Dammam, Bhopal, Manchester,  
Each city a chapter, none singular.

My roots don't dig deep into one soil,  
They sprawl like vines across continents,  
Drawing water from desert and monsoon toil,  
Finding nourishment in movement.

They ask: "Where are you from?"  
And I pause, searching for a simple answer,  
But the truth is a compass, never at home,  
Always pointing toward the next chapter.

Perhaps I'm not meant to be a tree,  
Firmly planted, unbending in the wind,  
But a bird that carries seeds,  
Planting forests wherever I've been.

And maybe that's the beauty of it all—  
Not belonging to one place, but to many,  
Not rooted to one soil, but to them all,  
Finding home in the journey, not the settling.
