Not every project succeeds. In fact, most don't. But each failure carries lessons that success never could teach.

## The Project That Never Launched

Last year, I spent three months building what I thought would be the next big thing. A platform that would solve a real problem I had experienced. I designed it, coded it, polished it—and then… nothing.

It turned out the problem I was solving was very specific to me. The handful of people I showed it to were polite but uninterested.

## What Went Wrong

The mistake wasn't in the execution—the code was solid, the design was clean. The mistake was in the assumption that my problem was everyone's problem. I never validated the idea before investing months of work.

## The Silver Lining

That "failed" project taught me:

1. **Validate early** - Talk to potential users before writing a single line of code
2. **Ship small** - Build the minimum version first, iterate based on feedback
3. **Detach from ideas** - Your first idea is rarely your best idea
4. **Learn the tools** - Even failed projects make you a better developer

## Reframing Failure

I've stopped seeing these projects as failures. They're experiments. Some experiments yield the results you expected, others teach you why your hypothesis was wrong. Both are valuable.

The real failure would be not trying at all.

## Moving Forward

Now, before I commit to building anything, I ask:
- Who is this for?
- What problem does it solve?
- How will I know if it's working?
- What's the smallest version I can ship?

Not every project will succeed, but every project will teach me something. And that's worth the effort.
