I still find running one of the strangest things I choose to do. 

Today I spent 2 hours and 2 minutes, that's thousand three hundred and twenty seconds doing something my body absolutely does not want to do, all for a higher purpose, a bigger goal. 

Just think about it … 

one… 

two… 

three… 

seven thousand and one… 

seven thousand and two… 

insane.

and somehow I kept moving. 

My friend and coach - Noah - once told me, “No one runs because they want to run,” and honestly, it hit me that day. He’s right. 

I don’t run because it’s fun. 

I run because doing something hard changes me. 

It forces me to show up when every part of me is saying anything but get up. 

Choosing discomfort and turning it into growth, choosing effort and turning it into joy, that’s the bit that sticks.

I’ve realised my biggest growth always came from doing the difficult things. 

And not being afraid to fail.

So now, when my desires say yes, I say no. 

When my body says yes, I say no.

 I get up anyway. 

And honestly,

that’s where unparalleled levels of happiness lie.
