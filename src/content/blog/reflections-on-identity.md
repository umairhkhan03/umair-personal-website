Growing up across different countries leaves you with a peculiar sense of identity. You're not quite from anywhere, yet somehow from everywhere.

## The Third Culture Kid Experience

I spent my formative years in Saudi Arabia—Riyadh and Dammam specifically. Those years shaped me in ways I'm still discovering. The warmth of the people, the rhythm of daily life, the food (oh, the food)—all of it became part of who I am.

Then there was India, my parents' homeland. Bhopal, with its own unique character, where I was both insider and outsider. I spoke the language, understood the culture, but something was always slightly different.

And now, in the UK, I find myself once again navigating that familiar feeling of being between worlds.

## Finding Home in Movement

For a long time, I saw this as a deficit—not having a single place to call "home" in the traditional sense. But I've come to realize it's actually a gift. My home isn't a place; it's a collection of experiences, memories, and connections that span continents.

## Language as Identity

Language plays a fascinating role in this. I think in English, dream in a mix of languages, and feel certain emotions most deeply in Urdu. Each language carries different parts of my identity, different ways of seeing the world.

## Moving Forward

I'm learning to embrace this multiplicity. Rather than trying to fit into a single box, I'm celebrating the complexity. After all, in an increasingly connected world, maybe being from everywhere is its own kind of belonging.
