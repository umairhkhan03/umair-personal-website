After years of putting it off, I finally decided to build a personal website. Not just another portfolio clone, but a space that truly represents who I am—both as a developer and as a person.

## Why Now?

The internet has become increasingly homogeneous. Everyone uses the same templates, the same layouts, the same design patterns. While there's nothing wrong with that, I wanted something different. Something that feels like *me*.

## The Tech Stack

I chose simplicity over complexity:

- **React + TypeScript** - For the component-based architecture I'm comfortable with
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development experience
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first styling that lets me iterate quickly
- **Markdown** - For content that's easy to write and maintain

## Design Philosophy

My approach was minimalistic but intentional. Every element serves a purpose. No unnecessary animations, no flashy graphics—just clean typography, thoughtful spacing, and content that matters.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. I plan to:
- Add more interactive elements
- Integrate with Goodreads for my reading list
- Create a showcase for side projects
- Write more regularly (this is the hard part)

The beauty of having your own space on the internet is that it can evolve with you. It's never finished, just continuously refined.
