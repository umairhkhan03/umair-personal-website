A digital platform for preserving and sharing poetry, with support for multiple languages and scripts. Designed to make poetry more accessible and discoverable.

## Inspiration

As someone who writes poetry in both English and Urdu, I was frustrated by the lack of platforms that handle multilingual poetry well. Most platforms either don't support right-to-left scripts properly or treat non-English content as an afterthought.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support** - Full support for English, Urdu, Arabic, and other languages with proper RTL rendering
- **Beautiful Typography** - Custom typography system that respects the nuances of different scripts
- **Audio Recordings** - Poets can upload audio recordings of their work
- **Translation View** - Side-by-side view for poems with translations
- **Collections** - Curated collections around themes, time periods, or movements

## Technical Approach

Built with Next.js for optimal performance and SEO:

- **MDX for Content** - Allows mixing markdown with React components for rich formatting
- **Internationalization** - Built-in i18n support for UI in multiple languages
- **Typography** - Custom font pairing for English (Crimson Pro) and Urdu (Noto Nastaliq)
- **Search** - Full-text search with support for multiple languages and scripts

## Design Philosophy

The design is intentionally minimal to let the poetry shine. White space, careful typography, and subtle animations create a contemplative reading experience.

## Impact

Since launching, the platform has hosted over 200 poems from 50+ poets across 8 languages. It's become a small but vibrant community of poetry enthusiasts.

## Next Steps

- Collaborative translation features
- Poetry challenges and prompts
- Educational resources about different poetic forms
- API for integrating with other platforms
